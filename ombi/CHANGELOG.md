# Changelog

## 4.60.6 (2026-06-19)

- Updated Ombi upstream version to `4.60.6`.
- Added a scheduled Ombi-only updater workflow.
- Switched Home Assistant to the generic multi-arch image `ghcr.io/wheemer/ombi-app`.
- Clarified the docs for Ombi's Base URL when running through Home Assistant ingress.
- Removed the internal ingress Base URL toggle from the user-facing app options.
- Fixed direct port access so published port `3579` is not blocked by the ingress proxy.
- Switched README branding to repo-hosted images and added a GitHub social preview image for forum link previews.
- Moved Ombi data to Home Assistant's backed-up app config storage and added a legacy config copy path.
- Fixed legacy Ombi migration so Ombi App imports existing `addons_config/ombi` data whenever the new app config does not already contain Ombi databases.
- Removed the old legacy config folder after a successful migration when Home Assistant permits it.
- Removed the broken upstream preview screenshot from the README files.

- Restructured the fork as a normal single-app repository with Ombi at `ombi/`.
- Added Home Assistant ingress support by setting Ombi's `BASE_URL` from the Supervisor ingress path.
- Published images under `ghcr.io/wheemer/ombi-app`.
- Restored Ombi `icon.png` and `logo.png` so Home Assistant shows the right branding.
- Removed broad device passthrough and the old custom AppArmor profile.
- Removed obsolete/deprecated warnings from the active fork metadata.
- Trimmed the build workflow and template scripts to the pieces this app actually uses.
- Rewrote README and funding links for the fork.
