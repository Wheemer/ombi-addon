# Welcome

Ombi is a friendly media request tool for Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin.

This repository packages Ombi as a Home Assistant App with ingress support. It opens from the Home Assistant sidebar and also exposes Ombi on port `3579` for direct local access.

# Installation

[![Add repository to Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FWheemer%2Fombi-app)

Manual repository URL:

```text
https://github.com/Wheemer/ombi-app
```

After adding the repository:

* Install the `Ombi` app.
* Start the app.
* Open Ombi from the Home Assistant sidebar or the app page's `Open Web UI` button.
* Direct local access is available on port `3579`.

# First Setup

Use Ombi's setup wizard to connect Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin first. After that, add your request automation tools such as Sonarr, Radarr, or Lidarr from Ombi's settings.

When ingress is enabled, the app sets Ombi's Base URL to Home Assistant's ingress path. In Ombi settings this looks like `/api/hassio_ingress/...`; leave it that way for sidebar access. The generic Ombi reverse-proxy instructions do not apply to Home Assistant ingress.

Ombi data is stored in the app's own backed-up config folder. If an older install has data in `addons_config/ombi`, the app copies it into the new storage location when `/config` is empty.

Ombi's own application docs are here:

* [Ombi installation docs](https://docs.ombi.app/installation/)

# Configuration

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|:-------:|-------------|
| `PUID` | `0` | User ID used for Ombi files |
| `PGID` | `0` | Group ID used for Ombi files |
| `env_vars` | `[]` | Extra environment variables passed to Ombi |

Example:

```yaml
PUID: 1000
PGID: 1000
env_vars: []
```

# Updates

The scheduled update workflow checks `Ombi-app/Ombi` prereleases and bumps the app version when Ombi changes. This follows the same stream used by the LinuxServer.io development image.
